This is a very brief introduction to TypeScript, intended for folks who know a little bit of JavaScript (or Python, Ruby, or any loosely-typed programming language)


a)  Installation (install the compiler on your system):

  npm install -g typescript

b)  Compiling a .ts file into JavaScript (.js), with hot reloading (watching):

  tsc filename.ts --watch

c)  Working with/compiling multiple files/folders:

  tsc --init
  tsc --watch
